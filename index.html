      <h3>About the Project</h3>
     <p>
       In Schleswig-Holstein, a natural genetic boundary runs between two subspecies of house mice: 
       <em>Mus musculus domesticus</em> (Western house mouse) and <em>Mus musculus musculus</em> (Eastern house mouse).
     </p>
     <p>
       These two subspecies meet along a narrow hybrid zone that stretches all the way across Europe—from the North Sea to the Black Sea. The section running through Schleswig-Holstein is just one piece of this larger evolutionary puzzle.
     </p>
     <p>
       Decades ago, a few samples suggested that this local hybrid zone runs North to South between areas like Malente and Lensahn, with pure subspecies found in Neumünster and Fehmarn Island. But no one has checked since the 1990s. We want to change that.
     </p>

      <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
      <p>
        This hybrid zone isn't just a line on a map—it’s a live laboratory for evolution. We’re especially interested in immune system genes, which may cross subspecies lines more often than other genes. These genes could reveal how animals adapt to disease, and how hybridization helps—or hurts—survival.

      <h3>What We're Doing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Collecting house mouse samples from Neumünster to Fehmarn</li>
        <li>Using modern genetic tools to pinpoint the hybrid zone</li>
        <li>Studying how genes move, mix, and affect survival</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to Recognize a House Mouse</h3>
      <p>Not all rodents found indoors are house mice. Other common species include the yellow-necked field mouse, wood mouse, and brown rat. Use the guide below to help determine if you have a house mouse.</p>
