      <h3>About the Project</h3>
      <p>
        In Schleswig-Holstein, a natural genetic boundary runs between two subspecies of house mice: <em>Mus musculus domesticus</em> (Western house mouse) and <em>Mus musculus musculus</em> (Eastern house mouse).
      </p>
      <p>
        Decades ago, a few samples suggested that this hybrid zone runs North to South between areas like Malente and Lensahn, with pure subspecies found in Neumünster and Fehmarn Island. But no one has checked since the 1990s. We want to change that.

      <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
      <p>
        This hybrid zone isn't just a line on a map—it’s a live laboratory for evolution. We’re especially interested in immune system genes, which may cross subspecies lines more often than other genes. These genes could reveal how animals adapt to disease, and how hybridization helps—or hurts—survival.

      <h3>What We're Doing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Collecting house mouse samples from Neumünster to Fehmarn</li>
        <li>Using modern genetic tools to pinpoint the hybrid zone</li>
        <li>Studying how genes move, mix, and affect survival</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Contact Us</h3>
      <p>
        Have you seen house mice around your home, farm, shed, or barn? We’re currently looking for house mice found dead (e.g., in traps or pest control) in the region. If you're willing to help or have questions, please get in touch!
